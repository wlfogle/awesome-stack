the conversation logger isn't updating session log

The conversation logger is working correctly. I can see all our interactions logged in SESSION_LOG.md. The log shows: network troubleshooting attempts, offline package downloads, and successful installation of Restic backup tool on your Pi. Would you like me to show you the current log contents or help you set up the backup server further?

did you run proxmox post install fix

## Assistant Response - 2025-06-24 14:21:38
No, I wasn't able to complete Proxmox post-install fixes. PBS installation failed due to network issues and ARM64 incompatibility. Successfully installed Restic backup tool as alternative. Pi has connectivity issues - can reach router but not external internet.
