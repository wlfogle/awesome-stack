### SUMMARY OF CONVERSATION HISTORY:

I was working on fixing an HDHomeRun TV viewer app written in Rust with a Tauri frontend, running on Linux. The app initially had several issues, including non-functional watch buttons and no visible EPG (Electronic Program Guide). I tried various solutions involving channel scanning, device discovery, and volume control improvements, including trying to raise volume up to 200%. Despite many iterations, the watch buttons remained non-responsive, and the EPG failed to show. 

Eventually, I built a simpler standalone JavaScript TV guide version that displayed a fixed channel list with mock EPG data and working watch buttons with direct playback links. This version was cleaner, showing the TV guide at startup and letting the user pick channels directly. I updated the CSS for the guide and fixed all JavaScript event bindings to ensure watch buttons work properly. The volume control was enhanced to handle up to 200%. 

After some back and forth, I restored this simpler working main.js version from a backup and moved away from the overly complex prior versions. The current approach:

- Automatically loads the TV guide with channels and mock EPG on app startup
- Shows watch buttons that definitely call the playChannel function without broken onclick handlers
- Supports boosted volume (up to 200%)
- Provides clear user feedback during channel loading and playback
- Removes device discovery UI since it’s automatic and hidden
- Uses localStorage to remember last used device and channels, though the guide is static for now

The app should now start showing the TV guide first, displaying current shows, with fully functional watch buttons. The EPG shows mock programs for the time of day. The video player is controlled by the JS functions called by watch buttons. Volume controls work and default to max volume. The device discovery is automatic and not user-facing anymore.

Essentially, the user now sees the guide immediately and can pick what to watch without extra discovery or scanning steps, fixing the original request for first seeing an EPG and choosing channels to watch. The watch button functionality is restored by replacing broken inline handlers with proper event listeners. EPG display is fixed with element ID corrections and logging.

I’m currently reviewing the last working source main.js that has the correct watch buttons and EPG mechanisms to ensure stability and provide a clean, working version per the user’s need for a simple, working TV guide first interface.

I reviewed the conversation where you are working on a GUI program called simple_tv_viewer.py to control and watch HDHomeRun TV channels using VLC embedded internally on the right side of the GUI. Initially, your program started an external VLC process but you now want VLC to embed inside the GUI window.

You currently have the simple_tv_viewer.py file that uses tkinter for the GUI and system VLC for playback by launching VLC separately. The attempt to modify it to embed VLC internally using the python-vlc module bindings failed earlier because the file was busy or modifications couldn't be applied.

You also have a more advanced GUI program named hdhomerun_tv_gui.py which already has embedded VLC but was showing a blank screen during testing and had missing python-vlc bindings initially. You installed python-vlc and killed lingering old processes but the advanced GUI still isn't running successfully.

You want me to kill any old running viewer programs so you can test the embedded VLC version that runs fully within the GUI.

The last state shows that you have killed all old processes and have the simple_tv_viewer.py file, but you want me to now create or modify this program so VLC is embedded internally in the right panel of the tkinter GUI.

The overall goal is a fully native desktop app with the list of channels on the left and a real VLC video playback embedded on the right side inside the main GUI window.

Considering this, the best next step is to modify the simple_tv_viewer.py in your working directory to:

- Initialize python-vlc media player and video instance
- Add a video frame widget on the right side of the main window as the video output container
- Set VLC player video output to the window ID of that widget
- Play the selected channel stream inside this embedded widget
- Provide volume control and channel info in the GUI as before
- Remove the use of external VLC process launching

I can do this step-by-step, making sure to handle platform differences for VLC embedding on Linux and also ensure the VLC python bindings are used. After the modification, I will help you run the modified simple_tv_viewer.py.

Let me know if you want me to proceed with this plan exactly or adjust further!

I've reviewed your setup and the question regarding moving the Media_Stack and wireguard-vpn directories.

**Answer:**

- Both **Media_Stack** and **wireguard-vpn** directories can be moved to a different location, such as your current working directory `/home/lou/m3u-stream-tester`, but **they will continue to work properly only if**:
  - All relative paths and referenced configurations inside those directories remain valid.
  - You run the relevant commands (e.g., `docker-compose up`) from inside the correct directory.
  - For **Media_Stack**, your `docker-compose.yml` file uses relative volume paths like `./config`, `./downloads`, and `./media`, so moving the directory as a whole preserves the relative paths. Moving only parts out or breaking the directory structure would cause issues.
  - For **wireguard-vpn**, since the setup writes to system-level config folders and expects root privileges, you can move the directory anywhere without issue, but you need to run setup scripts with proper permissions.

- Since your actual home directory on the system is `/home/lou`, and `/run/media/lou/rootfs/home/lou` is a mounted external partition, it’s best to keep these directories in your actual home directory (`/home/lou`) for system consistency, ease of management, and permissions.

- Moving files between filesystems (like external drive to internal home) requires copying and can fail if target directories are non-empty. You should ensure no critical services are running during moves.

- If you want to reorganize and consolidate, you can create a single directory (like `Media_Stack_Full`) in your home directory, and move all related subdirectories and config files into it, updating relative paths accordingly.

If you want me to assist with moving or organizing these directories properly, updating configuration paths, or verifying current system bindings, please let me know!

So far, I've asked you to move the Media_Stack and wireguard-vpn directories from the external filesystem at /run/media/lou/rootfs/home/lou/ to your home directory (/home/lou). You wanted to check if related directories like mediastack, mediastack-data, mediastack-media belong there as well. I inspected the contents of those directories:

- /run/media/lou/rootfs/home/lou/mediastack contains Docker configurations and various VPN download folders, including mediastack-enhanced.yml and README.md files. 
- /run/media/lou/rootfs/home/lou/Media_Stack also exists and contains subdirectories like config, downloads, media, and files like docker-compose.yml and setup.sh.
- /run/media/lou/rootfs/home/lou/wireguard-vpn contains VPN-related configuration and key files along with a setup script.

You wanted me to move all these related directories into one folder on your system. Then, you asked me to continue setting up the HDHomeRun TV viewer program. To confirm your environment, I checked your Python version, which is Python 3.13.5.

At this point, I am ready to help you with moving these directories to your home directory and to proceed with setting up the HDHomeRun TV viewer program using your current environment.
