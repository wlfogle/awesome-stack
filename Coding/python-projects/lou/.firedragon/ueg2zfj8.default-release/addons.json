Knowing where you're connected to adds an extra layer of awareness to your browsing and can be useful to indicate the native languages and legal jurisdictions that may apply. Additional information can be obtained via a multitude of external lookups and users can add their own custom actions. All actions can be added to the flag icon's context menu and set to icon click or keyboard shortcuts for quick access.\n\nClicking the flag icon loads our default action, Geotool, which gives a detailed map showing the city the server is in and other useful information such as its local time and ISP. Many other actions are available for a wide range of uses such as:\n\n    Site safety and malware checks\n    Finding similar sites and reviews\n    Automatic translation to your language\n    SEO and web development research\n    Diagnostics like pings and traceroutes\n    Whois and DNS information\n    Page code validation\n    Quick URL shortening\n    Copying a server's IP address or other info\n    or you can create your own custom actions!\n\nFlagfox is simple, unobtrusive, and uses relatively little resources. In order to protect your privacy, country lookups are done locally rather than asking an external server about every page you browse to. It works by accessing an internal IP address location database, basically a rough map of the physical layout of the Internet, based on data provided by Maxmind. This gives a flag for the nationality of the actual location of the server you're connected to, rather than just the nationality of the domain name which may be different. Flagfox updates are provided on a monthly basis to keep this internal database accurate.","weeklyDownloads":1203,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Dave G","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/235431/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/128/128264.png?modified=1622132177","width":331,"height":342,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/128/128264.jpg?modified=1622132177","thumbnailWidth":331,"thumbnailHeight":342,"caption":"Flagfox shows a flag icon in the location bar indicating the physical location of the current website's server.
