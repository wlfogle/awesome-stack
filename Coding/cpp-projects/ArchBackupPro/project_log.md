**‚ö° Current Focus - RGBCommandBatcher Implementation:**
Priority system with batched RGB commands for performance:
- Queue-based command collection
- Timed batch processing (max 50ms delay)
- Device fallback and error recovery
- Key group and individual key support
- Command prioritization for responsiveness

**üéØ Integration Goals:**
- Seamless integration with existing ArchBackupPro codebase
- Professional RGB control matching OriginPC quality
- Maintain backup/restore core functionality
- Clean separation of RGB modules for maintainability

**üìù Next Steps:**
1. Complete RGBCommandBatcher C++/Qt6 implementation
2. Create basic test GUI for RGB command verification
3. Port DeviceManager for multi-device support
4. Integration testing with /dev/hidraw devices
5. Add RGB control tab to ArchBackupPro interface
