# Multi-Agent Deployment Status

## Overview
Multiple AI agents are currently working on different aspects of the homelab infrastructure setup. This document tracks active deployments and coordination.

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-03 18:55:19 UTC

## Active Agent Tasks

### Agent 1: VNC & Warp Setup
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- **Task**: Setting up Warp terminal with VNC servers across all containers
- **Scope**: All 55+ containers in the homelab
- **Expected Outcome**: GUI access and resolved Warp connectivity issues

### Agent 2: Communication System (This Agent)
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Task**: Inter-agent communication system
- **Deliverables**: 
  - Message broker (CT-950)
  - Agent communication tools
  - Fallback systems for connectivity issues
  - Documentation and status tracking

## Container Inventory for VNC Setup

Based on `pct list`, the following containers are candidates for VNC/Warp setup:

### Core Infrastructure (High Priority)
- **CT-100**: WireGuard
- **CT-900**: AI Container
- **CT-950**: Agent Communications

### Media Stack (Medium Priority)
- **CT-230**: Plex
- **CT-231**: Jellyfin
- **CT-210**: Prowlarr
- **CT-212**: qBittorrent
- **CT-214**: Sonarr
- **CT-215**: Radarr

### Management/Monitoring (Medium Priority)
- **CT-260**: Prometheus
- **CT-261**: Grafana
- **CT-274**: Organizr
- **CT-275**: Homarr
- **CT-276**: Homepage

### Already Configured
- **CT-200**: alexa-desktop (VNC running on port 5901)

## Agent Coordination Notes

### Communication Channels
- Use `#deployment` channel for VNC/Warp setup progress
- Use `#alerts` for any issues or blockers
- Use `#general` for coordination messages

### Expected Integration Points
Once VNC/Warp setup is complete:
1. Test Warp connectivity from all containers
2. Verify agent communication via Warp terminals
3. Update documentation with new access methods
4. Migrate from fallback systems where applicable

## Monitoring During Deployment

### Key Metrics to Track
- Number of containers with successful VNC setup
- Warp connectivity test results
- Agent registration in message broker
- Any network or authentication issues

### Test Commands
```bash
# Check VNC processes in container
ssh proxmox "pct exec {CTID} -- ps aux | grep vnc"

# Test Warp connectivity
ssh proxmox "pct exec {CTID} -- curl -I https://app.warp.dev"

# Test agent communication
python3 agent-comms/chat.py read deployment
```

## Post-Deployment Tasks

Once VNC/Warp setup is complete:
1. Update agent status report
2. Test cross-container agent communication via Warp
3. Document VNC access ports and credentials
4. Create unified agent management interface
5. Implement agent coordination workflows

## Notes
- Message broker system remains operational during deployment
- Fallback communication methods available if needed
- All containers currently running and stable
- No service interruptions expected during VNC setup
