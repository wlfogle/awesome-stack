To optimize your router (Archer AX55 Pro) for performance, consider the following settings:

General Settings

1. Connection Type:
•  Use Dynamic IP if you do not have a static IP from your ISP.
2. Flow Control:
•  Enable both RX and TX if you face congestion problems, otherwise, leave them disabled as it might cause compatibility issues with some devices.
3. DHCP Server:
•  Set Auto unless you have a specific IP range setup.
•  Consider using IP Address Reservation for critical devices like servers or gaming consoles.

Wireless Settings

1. Wireless Radio:
•  Ensure it's Enabled for both bands.
•  Consider enabling Smart Connect to allow the router to automatically assign devices to the optimal band (2.4GHz or 5GHz).
2. 2.4GHz & 5GHz Channel:
•  Set both to Auto for the router to choose the least congested channel.
•  Use higher channels and 40MHz width for 5GHz where possible.
3. Transmit Power:
•  Set to High for maximum coverage.
4. OFDMA/MU-MIMO:
•  Leave enabled if supported by your devices for better bandwidth management.

Guest Network

1. Enable both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands for guests.
2. Use a simple password and configure guest permissions based on your comfort level.

IoT Network

1. Enable both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands for IoT with a dedicated SSID and strong password.
2. Enable AP Isolation if IoT devices don't need to communicate with each other.

Advanced Wireless Settings

1. WMM, Airtime Fairness, Zero Wait DFS:
•  Ensure these are Enabled to improve efficiency and fairness among devices.
2. Beacon Interval, RTS Threshold, DTIM Interval, Group Key Update Period:
•  Leave default unless you experience specific issues.

LAN and Ethernet

1. Use a Static IP for easier access to the router configuration page.
2. Ensure Full Duplex is set for all Ethernet ports for better performance.

Explore these settings through your router's administration page for optimal performance across your devices. Adjust based on specific requirements like gaming or video streaming. 

If you need more specific configurations or assistance, feel free to ask!

Ah, I understand now! You want to add DHCP reservations in your router for your Proxmox VM and its containers. Here's how to do it:

For the Proxmox VM (192.168.122.9)

1. Get the VM's MAC address:
•  In Proxmox web UI: Go to VM → Hardware → Network Device to see MAC address
•  Or SSH into Proxmox host: qm config <vmid> | grep net0
2. Add DHCP reservation:
•  Router Settings → Internet → DHCP Server → Address Reservation
•  Click "Add" or "+"
•  Enter:
◦  Device Name: "Proxmox-VM" (or whatever you prefer)
◦  MAC Address: The MAC from step 1
◦  Reserved IP: 192.168.122.9

For Containers Running in the VM

The challenge: Containers typically share the VM's network interface, so they don't have unique MAC addresses visible to your router's DHCP server.

Solutions:

Option 1: Use Docker with Bridge Networks (Recommended)
Containers will use the VM's IP (192.168.122.9) and different ports:
•  Container 1: 192.168.122.9:8080
•  Container 2: 192.168.122.9:8081
•  etc.

Option 2: Use Macvlan Networks (Advanced)
If you need containers to have their own IPs:

1. On the VM, create macvlan network:

docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.122.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.122.1 \
  -o parent=eth0 macvlan-net

2. Run containers with unique IPs:

docker run -d --network=macvlan-net --ip=192.168.122.10 container1
docker run -d --network=macvlan-net --ip=192.168.122.11 container2

3. Get container MAC addresses:

docker inspect <container> | grep MacAddress

4. Add DHCP reservations for each container using their MAC addresses and desired IPs.

Which approach do you prefer? Most people use Option 1 (port mapping) as it's simpler and more secure.

Perfect! For your LXC containers, here's how to set up DHCP reservation and access them through the VM's IP:

DHCP Reservation (Router Settings)

Add one reservation for the Proxmox VM:
•  Device Name: "Proxmox-VM-Media-Stack" 
•  MAC Address: Your VM's MAC address
•  Reserved IP: 192.168.122.9

LXC Container Access Setup

Since your containers have specific functions, here's the typical port mapping:

Option 1: Configure each LXC container to bind to VM's IP
In each container, configure services to bind to specific ports on 192.168.122.9:

CT 100 (WireGuard):
•  Access: 192.168.122.9:51820 (WireGuard default port)

CT 102 (Gluetun):
•  Web UI: 192.168.122.9:8000 (if using web interface)
•  HTTP Proxy: 192.168.122.9:8888
•  SOCKS5 Proxy: 192.168.122.9:8388

CT 103 (Traefik):
•  Dashboard: 192.168.122.9:8080
•  HTTP: 192.168.122.9:80
•  HTTPS: 192.168.122.9:443

CT 104 (FlareSolverr):
•  API: 192.168.122.9:8191

Option 2: Use iptables on the VM for port forwarding
On your Proxmox VM, set up forwarding rules:

# Forward traffic from VM to containers
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination <traefik-ct-ip>:8080
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8191 -j DNAT --to-destination <flaresolverr-ct-ip>:8191
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 51820 -j DNAT --to-destination <wireguard-ct-ip>:51820
# Add MASQUERADE rule
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE

Which approach would you prefer? Option 1 is cleaner if you can configure the services directly, Option 2 is more flexible if the container configs are harder to modify.
