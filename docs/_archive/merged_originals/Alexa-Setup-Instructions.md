    filter:
      include_entities:
        - script.movie_night
        - script.system_status
        - script.ai_assistant_status

movie_night:
  alias: "Movie Night Mode"
  sequence:
    - service: rest_command.check_plex_status

      data:
        message: "Plex and Jellyfin ready for streaming!"
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Device not found"**
   - Wait 2 minutes after restart
   - Say: "Alexa, discover my devices"

2. **"Server not responding"**
   - Check Home Assistant is running: `http://homeassistant.local:8123`
   - Verify configuration syntax

3. **"Commands not working"**
   - Check scripts are loaded: Developer Tools → Services
   - Look for errors in: Settings → System → Logs

### **Test Commands Manually:**
```bash
# Test if services respond
curl http://192.168.122.230:32400/status/sessions  # Plex
curl http://192.168.122.172:11434/api/version      # AI
curl http://192.168.122.103:9080/api/overview      # Traefik
```

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Alexa says "OK" to your commands
- ✅ Home Assistant shows notifications

- ✅ Devices show up in Alexa app

## 🚀 **Next Steps After Basic Setup**

1. **Create Routines**: Custom Alexa routines in the app
2. **Add More Scripts**: Specific service controls
3. **Enable TTS**: Alexa speaks responses back
4. **Custom Skills**: Advanced voice interactions

## 📱 **Alexa App Routines** (Advanced)

Create these routines in the Alexa app:

### **"Server Check" Routine:**
- **Trigger**: "Alexa, check my server"
- **Action**: Turn on "system status"
- **Response**: "Checking your media stack"

### **"Movie Time" Routine:**
- **Trigger**: "Alexa, it's movie time"
- **Action**: Turn on "entertainment mode"
