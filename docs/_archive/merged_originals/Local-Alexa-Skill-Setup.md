# üìÑ **Project Documentation: Local Alexa Skill for Voice Control**

---

## **1. Goal & Architecture**

**Goal:** To establish a secure, self-hosted connection between the Amazon Alexa ecosystem and the Home Assistant instance (`192.168.122.113`) without relying on the Nabu Casa cloud subscription. This enables the Echo Frames and other Alexa devices to control the 47+ container homelab stack via custom voice commands processed locally.

**Updated Architecture (Using Tailscale):**
```
Your Voice ‚Üí [Echo Frames] ‚Üí [Amazon Alexa Cloud]
                                    ‚Üì (HTTPS/TLS)
[Internet] ‚Üí [Tailscale Network] ‚Üí [lou-eon17x (100.96.98.61)]
                                    ‚Üì (Subnet Route: 192.168.122.0/24)
            [Traefik Reverse Proxy (CT 103)] ‚Üí [Home Assistant (VM 500)]
```

**Network Details:**
- **Tailscale Device**: `lou-eon17x` (IP: `100.96.98.61`)
- **Homelab Network**: `192.168.122.0/24` (advertised via Tailscale subnet route)
- **Home Assistant**: `192.168.122.113:8123`
- **Traefik**: `192.168.122.103:8080/8443`

---

## **2. Implementation Plan & Steps**

### **Step 1: Tailscale Network Setup** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

**Implementation Summary:**
- ‚úÖ Tailscale installed on `lou-eon17x` (IP: `100.96.98.61`)
- ‚úÖ Subnet route `192.168.122.0/24` advertised and **APPROVED**
- ‚úÖ IP forwarding enabled on Garuda host
- ‚úÖ Network connectivity tested and verified

**Technical Details:**
```bash
# Installation command used:
sudo pacman -S tailscale --noconfirm
sudo systemctl enable --now tailscaled
sudo tailscale up --advertise-routes=192.168.122.0/24 --accept-routes

# IP forwarding configuration:
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
echo 'net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
```

**Connectivity Tests:**
- ‚úÖ Home Assistant accessible: `http://192.168.122.113:8123` (HTTP 200)
- ‚úÖ Tailscale status: `100.96.98.61 lou-eon17x loufogle@ linux -`
- ‚úÖ Subnet route approved in Tailscale admin console

**Result:** Your entire homelab network (`192.168.122.0/24`) is now securely accessible through the Tailscale network!

### **Step 2: Dynamic DNS with DuckDNS**
1.  **Create a DuckDNS Account:** Go to `https://www.duckdns.org/` and sign in with a provider.
2.  **Create a Domain:** Create a unique subdomain (e.g., `your-homelab-name.duckdns.org`).
3.  **Get Token:** Note down your DuckDNS token from the dashboard.
4.  **Set up Auto-Update:**
    *   Install the official **Duck DNS add-on** in Home Assistant from the Add-on Store.
    *   Configure the add-on with your new domain and token.
    *   This ensures your domain always points to your home's public IP address.

### **Step 2: SSL Certificate with Let's Encrypt**
1.  **Use Traefik:** Your existing Traefik setup (CT 103) is already configured to manage Let's Encrypt certificates automatically for your services.
2.  **Update Traefik Configuration:**
    *   Add a new router rule in your Traefik dynamic configuration file (e.g., `routers.yml`).
    *   This rule will route traffic from `your-homelab-name.duckdns.org` to the Home Assistant IP (`192.168.122.113:8123`).
    *   Ensure the `tls.certresolver` is set to your existing Let's Encrypt resolver. Traefik will handle the certificate procurement and renewal.

### **Step 3: Home Assistant Configuration**
1.  **Configure `http` Integration:** In your `configuration.yaml`, ensure the `http` section includes your Traefik reverse proxy's IP address in the `trusted_proxies` list. This is critical for security.
    ```yaml
    http:
      use_x_forwarded_for: true
      trusted_proxies:
        - 192.168.122.103  # IP of your Traefik container
    ```
2.  **Add Alexa Integration:**
    *   Go to **Settings > Integrations > Add Integration**.
    *   Search for and add **"Amazon Alexa"**.

### **Step 4: Amazon Developer Console & Skill Setup**
1.  **Create an Amazon Developer Account:** Sign up at `https://developer.amazon.com/`.
2.  **Create a New Alexa Skill:**
    *   Go to the Alexa Developer Console and click "Create Skill".
    *   **Name:** "Home Assistant" or similar.
    *   **Model:** "Smart Home".
3.  **Configure the Skill:**
    *   **Skill ID:** Note this down. You will need it in Home Assistant.
    *   **Default Endpoint:** This is the most critical part. Enter the HTTPS URL of your Home Assistant instance: `https://your-homelab-name.duckdns.org/api/alexa/smart_home`
    *   **Account Linking:**
        *   **Authorization URI:** `https://your-homelab-name.duckdns.org/auth/authorize`
        *   **Access Token URI:** `https://your-homelab-name.duckdns.org/auth/token`
        *   **Client ID:** `https://pitangui.amazon.com/` (for skills in the US) or the appropriate URL for your region.
        *   **Client Secret:** Create a long, random string.
        *   **Scope:** `smart_home`
4.  **Finalize Skill & Connect:**
    *   Link the skill to your personal Amazon account.
    *   In Home Assistant, add the Alexa Skill ID and the Client Secret you created.
    *   Discover devices by saying "Alexa, discover devices."
