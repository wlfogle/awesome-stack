# üöÄ Enhanced AI Assistant - User Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Launch the Application
```bash
cd /home/lou/awesome_stack/open-interpreter-tauri
npm run tauri dev
```

### 2. First Time Setup
When you first launch the application:

1. **Configure AI Models**: Set up your preferred AI providers (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)
2. **Initialize Memory System**: The system will create its memory database
3. **Set Preferences**: Configure your coding style, response preferences, and tool settings

### 3. Basic Usage

#### Start a Conversation
```
Hey, can you help me analyze this codebase?
```

The AI will:
- Remember this as your first interaction
- Start building a profile of your preferences
- Initialize project context if you're in a code directory

#### Upload Files
Drag and drop or use the file picker to upload:
- **Images**: Screenshots, diagrams, UI mockups
- **Documents**: PDFs, Word docs, text files
- **Code Files**: Any programming language
- **Audio**: Voice memos, recordings
- **Video**: Screen recordings, presentations

#### Ask Complex Questions
```
"Analyze this screenshot of my app's UI, review the code behind it, 
and suggest improvements based on the design document I uploaded earlier."
```

The AI will:
- Process the image (UI analysis)
- Review the code (syntax, structure, performance)
- Cross-reference with your document
- Provide unified recommendations

## Core Features

### üß† Memory System

#### How It Works
- **Remembers Everything**: Every conversation, preference, and interaction
- **Learns Patterns**: Recognizes what works best for you
- **Builds Context**: Understands your projects and coding style
- **Adapts Responses**: Gets better at helping you over time

#### Memory Types
- **Episodic**: "Last week you asked about React optimization"
- **Semantic**: "You prefer functional programming patterns"
- **Procedural**: "Your usual workflow: test ‚Üí review ‚Üí deploy"
- **Working**: "Currently working on the authentication module"
- **Emotional**: "You get frustrated with unclear error messages"

#### Example Interaction
```
You: "I'm having the same issue with async functions as before"

AI: "I remember you had trouble with Promise handling in your React components 
last month. Based on your preference for TypeScript and functional patterns, 
here's a solution that matches your coding style..."
```

### üîç Code Intelligence

#### Capabilities
- **Deep Analysis**: Understands code structure, not just syntax
- **Security Scanning**: Identifies vulnerabilities and suggests fixes
- **Performance Review**: Spots bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Refactoring Suggestions**: Smart code improvements
- **Documentation Generation**: Auto-creates docs from your code

#### Usage Examples

**Analyze Project:**
```
"Review my entire project for technical debt and security issues"
```

**Get Suggestions:**
```
"How can I improve this function?" [paste code]
```

**Refactor Code:**
```
"This function is too long, help me break it down"
```

### üé® Multi-Modal Processing

#### What You Can Do
- **Image Analysis**: "What's wrong with this UI design?"
- **Audio Processing**: Upload voice memos for transcription and analysis
- **Document Review**: "Summarize this 50-page requirements document"
- **Video Analysis**: "Review this screen recording of the bug"
- **Combined Analysis**: Process multiple media types together

#### Example Workflows

**Design Review:**
1. Upload UI mockup (image)
2. Upload current implementation (code)
3. Ask: "How well does my code match this design?"

**Bug Investigation:**
1. Upload error screenshot (image)
2. Upload log files (text)
3. Upload relevant code (files)
4. Ask: "What's causing this error and how do I fix it?"

## Advanced Features

### üîß Tool Integration

Your AI has access to 17+ built-in tools:

#### File Operations
- `read_file`: Read any file
- `write_file`: Create/modify files
- `search_files`: Find files by pattern
- `list_directory`: Browse folders

#### Code Execution
- `execute_shell`: Run terminal commands
- `execute_python`: Run Python scripts
- `execute_node`: Run JavaScript/TypeScript
- `execute_rust`: Compile and run Rust code

#### System Monitoring
- `process_list`: See running processes
- `system_info`: Hardware and OS details
- `network_info`: Network configuration

#### Git Integration
- `git_status`: Repository status
- `git_log`: Commit history
- `git_diff`: File changes

#### Example Usage
```
"Check if the server is running, and if not, start it"

AI will:
1. Use `process_list` to check for the server
2. Use `execute_shell` to start it if needed
3. Use `network_info` to verify it's accessible
4. Report back with status
```

### üéØ Learning & Adaptation

#### Pattern Recognition
The AI learns from your interactions:

```
After 10 code reviews, it notices:
- You always ask about performance first
- You prefer detailed explanations
- You like seeing before/after comparisons
- You want security considerations mentioned

Future code reviews automatically include all of this!
```

#### Preference Learning
```
You: "Make the explanation shorter"
AI: "Got it! I'll be more concise going forward."

[Stores: User prefers concise responses for code explanations]
[Updates all future responses to be more brief]
```

#### Context Building
```
Working on Project X for 2 weeks:
- AI learns your architecture patterns
- Remembers your team's coding standards  
- Understands your deployment process
- Knows your common pain points

Result: Suggestions automatically align with your project context
```

## Best Practices

### üí° Getting the Most Out of Memory

#### Be Specific About Preferences
```
Good: "I prefer TypeScript with strict mode, functional components, 
and detailed JSDoc comments"

Better than: "I like TypeScript"
```

#### Provide Feedback
```
"That explanation was too technical, can you simplify it?"
"Perfect! That's exactly the level of detail I need."
"I prefer seeing code examples before theory."
```

#### Rate Responses (when prompted)
- The AI learns from satisfaction scores
- Low scores help it avoid similar responses
- High scores reinforce successful patterns

### üîç Effective Code Analysis

#### Provide Context
```
Good: "Review this authentication function for security issues, 
focusing on JWT handling and session management"

Better than: "Review this code"
```

#### Use Multi-Modal Analysis
```
"Here's my code [file], design mockup [image], and requirements [document]. 
Are they all aligned?"
```

#### Ask Follow-Up Questions
```
"You mentioned this could cause memory leaks. Can you show me exactly 
where and how to fix it?"
```

### üé® Multi-Modal Tips

#### Combine Media Types
```
- Screenshot of error + log files + relevant code
- UI design + implementation + user feedback
- Architecture diagram + code structure + performance metrics
```

#### Be Clear About Intent
```
Good: "Analyze this image for UI/UX issues and suggest improvements"
Better than: "What do you think of this?"
```

#### Use Voice Memos
```
Record voice notes while coding:
"I'm struggling with this async pattern, it's not behaving as expected..."

AI will transcribe and provide relevant help based on your spoken context.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### AI Responses Seem Generic
**Solution**: Provide more context and feedback
```
Instead of: "Help with this code"
Try: "This React component is causing performance issues in my 
e-commerce app. Users complain about slow rendering when filtering products."
```

#### Memory Not Working
**Solution**: Check if the database is writable
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la ~/.local/share/ai-assistant/

# Reset if needed
rm ~/.local/share/ai-assistant/memory.db
```

#### Code Analysis Missing Features
**Solution**: Ensure language parsers are available
```bash
# Check if tree-sitter parsers are installed
cargo build --features tree-sitter-all
```

#### Multi-Modal Processing Slow
**Solution**: Optimize media file sizes
- Images: Keep under 10MB, use PNG/JPG
- Audio: Use common formats (WAV, MP3)
- Documents: PDF preferred over Word docs
- Videos: Keep under 100MB

### Performance Optimization

#### Memory Usage
```toml
# In config.toml
[memory]
max_memories = 5000  # Reduce if using too much RAM
consolidation_interval = 1800  # More frequent cleanup
```

#### Processing Speed
```toml
# In config.toml
[ai]
temperature = 0.3  # Lower = faster, less creative
max_tokens = 2048  # Shorter responses = faster

[multimodal]
quality_level = "Fast"  # vs "Balanced" or "HighQuality"
```

#### Storage Management
```bash
# Clean old cache files
find ~/.cache/ai-assistant -type f -mtime +30 -delete

# Compact database
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/ai-assistant/memory.db "VACUUM;"
```
