Yes, you can deploy Ansible AWX in an LXC (Linux Containers) container as a native application. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:

A host machine with LXC installed.
Basic knowledge of LXC commands.
Docker installed inside the LXC container (AWX runs as a set of Docker containers).
üê≥ Steps to Deploy Ansible AWX in LXC
1. Create an LXC Container
You can create a new LXC container using the following command:

bash

Copy Code
lxc launch ubuntu:20.04 awx-container
This command creates a new container named awx-container based on Ubuntu 20.04.

2. Access the Container
Enter the container using:

bash

Copy Code
lxc exec awx-container -- /bin/bash
3. Install Docker
Inside the container, install Docker:

bash

Copy Code
apt update
apt install -y docker.io
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
4. Install Docker Compose
Install Docker Compose to manage the AWX deployment:

bash

Copy Code
apt install -y python3-pip
pip3 install docker-compose
5. Clone the AWX Repository
Clone the AWX repository from GitHub:

bash

Copy Code
git clone https://github.com/ansible/awx.git
cd awx/installer
6. Configure AWX
Edit the inventory file to set up your AWX configuration. You can specify the admin user, password, and other settings.

7. Deploy AWX
Run the installation playbook using Docker Compose:

bash

Copy Code
ansible-playbook -i inventory install.yml
8. Access AWX
Once the installation is complete, you can access the AWX web interface by navigating to http://<container-ip>:80 in your web browser.

‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations
Ensure that your LXC container has enough resources (CPU, RAM) to run AWX effectively.
Networking configurations may need to be adjusted based on your environment.
You may want to set up persistent storage for your AWX data.
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully deploy Ansible AWX in an LXC container as a native application. If you have any specific questions or run into issues, feel free to ask!


docker is not native install


.
GPT-4o mini
You're correct that Docker is not a native installation in the sense that it runs as a daemon and manages containers, which may not align with the concept of a "native" application in an LXC container. Instead, you can run Ansible AWX directly using the provided installation methods without relying on Docker. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

üõ†Ô∏è Deploying Ansible AWX Natively in an LXC Container
1. Create an LXC Container
Start by creating a new LXC container:

lxc launch ubuntu:20.04 awx-container


Copy Code
lxc launch ubuntu:20.04 awx-container
2. Access the Container
Enter the container:

lxc exec awx-container -- /bin/bash


Copy Code
lxc exec awx-container -- /bin/bash
3. Install Required Packages
Install the necessary packages for AWX:

apt update
apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv git ansible


Copy Code
apt update
apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv git ansible
4. Clone the AWX Repository
Clone the AWX repository:

git clone https://github.com/ansible/awx.git
cd awx/installer


Copy Code
git clone https://github.com/ansible/awx.git
cd awx/installer
5. Configure AWX
Edit the inventory file to set up your AWX configuration. You can specify the admin user, password, and other settings.

6. Install AWX
Run the installation playbook using Ansible:

ansible-playbook -i inventory install.yml


Copy Code
ansible-playbook -i inventory install.yml
7. Access AWX
Once the installation is complete, you can access the AWX web interface by navigating to http://<container-ip>:80 in your web browser.

‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations
Ensure that your LXC container has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM) to run AWX effectively.
Networking configurations may need to be adjusted based on your environment.
You may want to set up persistent storage for your AWX data.
This method allows you to run Ansible AWX without Docker, making it a more native installation within the LXC container. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!


i'm running proxmox in vm on garuda linux host



.
GPT-4o mini
Given that you're running Proxmox in a VM on a Garuda Linux host, deploying Ansible AWX in an LXC container within Proxmox can be done effectively. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide tailored to your setup:

üõ†Ô∏è Deploying Ansible AWX in an LXC Container on Proxmox
1. Create an LXC Container in Proxmox
Log in to the Proxmox web interface.
Create a new LXC container:
Click on "Create CT."
Fill in the container ID, hostname, and password.
Choose a template (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04).
Configure resources (CPU, RAM, Disk).
Set up networking (ensure it has access to the internet).
Finish the creation process.
2. Access the LXC Container
Once the container is created, access it via the Proxmox console or SSH:

lxc exec <container-id> -- /bin/bash


Copy Code
lxc exec <container-id> -- /bin/bash
3. Install Required Packages
Inside the container, install the necessary packages:

apt update
apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv git ansible


Copy Code
apt update
apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv git ansible
4. Clone the AWX Repository
Clone the AWX repository:

git clone https://github.com/ansible/awx.git
cd awx/installer


Copy Code
git clone https://github.com/ansible/awx.git
cd awx/installer
5. Configure AWX
Edit the inventory file to set up your AWX configuration. You can specify the admin user, password, and other settings.

6. Install AWX
Run the installation playbook using Ansible:

ansible-playbook -i inventory install.yml


Copy Code
ansible-playbook -i inventory install.yml
7. Access AWX
Once the installation is complete, you can access the AWX web interface by navigating to http://<container-ip>:80 in your web browser.

‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations
Resource Allocation: Ensure that your LXC container has enough resources (CPU, RAM) to run AWX effectively.
Networking: Make sure the container has proper network access to reach the internet and any other necessary services.
Persistent Storage: Consider setting up persistent storage for your AWX data if needed.
This approach allows you to run Ansible AWX natively in an LXC container managed by Proxmox on your Garuda Linux host. If you have any specific questions or run into issues, feel free to ask!
